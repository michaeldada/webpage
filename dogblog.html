      Today I woke up and ran outside to find it had snowed overnight!  My owners were so happy, and so was I.  The white cold water felt so good to run and play in.

      I was so scared today, there were so many load noises outside.  I slept most of the day and then I got a special treat from my owners.  I guess it was a special day for them, but it was just loud for me.
